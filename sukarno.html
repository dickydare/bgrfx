				<h1>Biography of Sukarno, Indonesia's First President</h1>
<p>Sukarno (June 6, 1901&ndash;June 21, 1970) was the first leader of independent <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/indonesia-facts-and-history-195522">Indonesia</a>. Born in Java when the island was part of the Dutch East Indies, Sukarno rose to power in 1949. Rather than supporting Indonesia's original parliamentary system, he created a "guided democracy" over which he held control. Sukarno was deposed by a military coup in 1965 and died under house arrest in 1970.</p>
<p><strong>Early Life </strong></p>
<p>Sukarno was born on June 6, 1901, in <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/geography-of-indonesia-1435052">Surabaya</a>, and was given the name Kusno Sosrodihardjo. His parents later renamed him Sukarno after he survived a serious illness. Sukarno's father was Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo, a Muslim aristocrat and school teacher from Java. His mother Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai was a Hindu of the <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/who-are-the-brahmins-195316">Brahmin caste</a> from Bali.</p>

<p>Young Sukarno went to a local elementary school until 1912. He then attended a Dutch middle school in Mojokerto, followed in 1916 by a Dutch high school in Surabaya. The young man was gifted with a <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/visual-learning-style-3212062">photographic memory</a> and a talent for languages, including Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, Dutch, English, French, Arabic, Bahasa Indonesia, German, and Japanese.</p>
<h2>Indonesian independence</h2>
<p>For his challenge to colonialism Sukarno spent two years in a Dutch jail (1929&ndash;31) in Bandung and more than eight years in exile (1933&ndash;42) on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Flores-Indonesia">Flores</a> and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. When the Japanese invaded the Indies in March 1942, he welcomed them as personal and national liberators. During <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II">World War II</a> the Japanese made Sukarno their chief adviser and propagandist and their recruiter for labourers, soldiers, and prostitutes. Sukarno pressured the Japanese to grant Indonesia its independence and, on June 1, 1945, made the most famous of many celebrated speeches. In it he defined the Pantjasila (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pancasila">Pancasila</a>), or Five Principles (nationalism, internationalism, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy">democracy</a>, social prosperity, and belief in God), still the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sacrosanct">sacrosanct</a> state doctrine. When the collapse of Japan became <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/imminent">imminent</a>, Sukarno at first wavered. Then, after being kidnapped, intimidated, and persuaded by activist youths, he declared Indonesia&rsquo;s independence (August 17, 1945). As president of the shaky new republic, he fueled a successful defiance of the Dutch, who, after two abortive &ldquo;police actions&rdquo; to regain control, formally transferred <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sovereignty">sovereignty</a> on December 27, 1949.</p>
<p>From his revolutionary capital in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Yogyakarta-Indonesia">Yogyakarta</a> (formerly Jogjakarta), Sukarno returned in triumph to Jakarta on December 28, 1949. There he established himself, his collection of paintings, and his numerous retinue in the splendid palace of the Dutch governors-general. He proceeded to preside urbanely over a spectacle that was at once diverting and disturbing. His increasingly numerous and outspoken critics maintained that Sukarno inspired no <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coherent">coherent</a> programs of national organization and administration, rehabilitation, and development, such as were quite clearly necessary. He seemed instead to conduct a continuous series of formal and informal audiences and a nightly <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soiree">soiree</a> of receptions, banquets, music, dancing, movies, and wayang. Indonesian politics became increasingly frenzied, with Sukarno himself engaged in <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/devious">devious</a> maneuvers that made stabilization impossible. The Indonesian economy foundered while Sukarno encouraged the wildest of extravagances. To be sure, the nation scored impressive gains in health, education, and cultural self-awareness and self-expression. It achieved, in fact, what Sukarno himself most joyously sought and acclaimed as &ldquo;national identity,&rdquo; an exhilarating sense of pride in being Indonesian. But this achievement came at a ruinous cost.</p>
<p>After &ldquo;dreaming&rdquo; in late 1956 of &ldquo;burying&rdquo; the feuding political parties in Indonesia and thus achieving national <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus">consensus</a> and prosperity, Sukarno dismantled parliamentary democracy and destroyed free enterprise. He ordained &ldquo;Guided Democracy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guided Economy&rdquo; for the achievement of Manipol-Usdek and Resopim-Nasakom&mdash;arcane <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acronyms">acronyms</a> symbolizing policies but signifying dictatorship.</p>
<p>Sukarno&rsquo;s personal and political excesses, as epitomized eventually by his neo-Marxist, crypto-communist <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ideology-society">ideology</a> and his infamous cabinet of 100 corrupt and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cynical">cynical</a> ministers, induced a continuous state of national crisis. Sukarno narrowly escaped recurrent attempts at assassination, the first in 1957. Regional insurrections broke out in Sumatra and Sulawesi in 1958. Inflation escalated the cost-of-living index from 100 in 1958 to 18,000 in 1965 and on up wildly to 600,000 in 1967. In 1963, after shouting repeatedly &ldquo;To hell with your aid&rdquo; (1950&ndash;65 total: U.S. $1,000,000,000), Sukarno all but broke with the United States. After having exacted U.S. $1,000,000,000 in Soviet armaments and other items, he next affronted Moscow.</p>
<p>On January 20, 1965, Indonesia formally withdrew from the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Nations">United Nations</a> because the latter supported Malaysia, which Sukarno had vowed to &ldquo;crush&rdquo; as &ldquo;an imperialist plot of encirclement.&rdquo; Yet, until 1965, Sukarno was still able to stir the Indonesian masses to near-hysterical belligerency. Millions of Indonesians sang and shouted his slogans and acclaimed Sukarno as &ldquo;Great Leader of the Revolution,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lifetime President&rdquo; (his official title), and oracle and warrior of the Nefo&mdash;his <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acronym">acronym</a> for the &ldquo;New Emerging Forces&rdquo;&mdash;in violent conflict with Nekolim&mdash;the neocolonialism, capitalism, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/imperialism">imperialism</a> of the &ldquo;doomed&rdquo; Western powers.</p>
<h2>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/September-30th-Movement">coup of 1965</a></h2>
<p>The nation was shocked and shaken out of its trance by an abortive coup on September 30, 1965. A clique of military conspirators calling itself the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/September-30th-Movement">September 30th Movement</a> kidnapped and killed six top army generals, seized a few key urban points, and proclaimed a new revolutionary regime. General <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Suharto">Suharto</a>, the commander of the Jakarta garrison, swiftly reversed the coup.</p>
<p>Suharto and the military generally believed the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indonesian-Communist-Party">Indonesian Communist Party</a> (Partai Komunis Indonesia; PKI)&mdash;which to some measure had been supported and protected by Sukarno&mdash;to be behind the attempted coup. The PKI, by contrast, understood the plot to be entirely a military matter. There ensued an oblique contest for power between Suharto and Sukarno, during which thousands of communists and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alleged">alleged</a> communists were slaughtered by the military; estimates of the number of people killed during the purge range from 80,000 to more than 1,000,000. As the country recoiled in horror, activist youths demanded the political <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demise">demise</a> of Sukarno, the Sukarnoists, and Sukarnoism and the total reform and reorganization of the state. On March 11, 1966, Sukarno was obliged to delegate wide powers to Suharto, who subsequently became acting president (March 1967) and then president (March 1968), as Sukarno sank into disgrace and dotage.</p>
<h2>Death</h2>
<p>Sukarno died at the age of 69 of a chronic kidney ailment and numerous complications. Suharto decreed a quick and quiet funeral. Nevertheless, at least 500,000 persons, including virtually all of Jakarta&rsquo;s important personages, turned out to pay their last ambivalent respects. The next day another 200,000 assembled in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Blitar">Blitar</a>, near Surabaya, for the official service followed by burial in a simple grave alongside that of his mother. The cult and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ideology">ideology</a> of Sukarnoism were proscribed until the late 1970s, when the government undertook a rehabilitation of Sukarno&rsquo;s name. His autobiography, <em>Sukarno,</em> was published in 1965.</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Sukarno left behind an independent Indonesia&mdash;a major achievement of international proportions. On the other hand, despite his rehabilitation as a respected political figure, Sukarto also created a set of issues that continue to plague today's Indonesia. His daughter, Megawati, became Indonesia's fifth president.</p>
